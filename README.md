# Lesson 3
The lesson 3 folder contains two case studies, where both are part of the creation of modules for Python, where the first code is adapting the previous Case 2 but now breaking down the classes to each respective .py file; the second case is about implementing geometrical figures also using the four common figures as classes inside their exclusive Python file and access them as modules
